<p><strong>What is an operating system?</strong> <br>
<li>Every computer is made up of hardware such as CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices like desktop, keyboard, & mouse.<br>
    All the programs running on the computer need to use these hardware resources.
</li>
</p>

<p>Why we need operating system? <br>
Let's take an example:- <br>
    <ul>
        <li>To use applications like Chrome, it will require to use CPU, memory & some I/O devices, so that user can interact and do the job.
            <ul>
                <li>Apps don't know how to talk to the hardware.</li>
                <li>Apps can't be installed directly on the hardware.</li>
            </ul>    
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>We need to write code for that application and configuration with the hardware in order to use the application on hardware. <br> Then it will be so inefficient. So, to remove this inefficiency we use intermediate to talk to the hardware and that intermediate is known as Operating System. <br>
Operating System can interact with hardware & applications so it is like a middleman between the two. </p>

<p>What are the tasks of O.S.? <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Process Management</li>
        <li>Memory Management</li>
        <li>Storage Management</li>
        <li>Manage File System</li>
        <li>Management of I/O Devices</li>
        <li>Security & Networking and so on.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>How an O.S. is constructed? <br>

<ul>
    <li>Kernel is a program which consists of devices drivers, dispatcher, scheduler, file system, etc.</li>
    <li>Kernel always loads first. It is the heart of every operating system responsible for managing hardware components</li>
    <li>Kernel starts the process for app, allocate resources to it & also cleans up the resources when app shuts down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eg:- Different Linux Distros like Ubuntu, Mint, CentOS, etc. Android is also based on linux kernel.</p>
</p>

<p>Linux Kernel is most widely used. On the other hand, MacOS & IOS are based on different kernel known as Darwin.</p>

<p>How to interact with kernel? <br>
Graphical User Interface(GUI) ---> Command Line Interface(CLI) <br>
There are 3 main operating system for computers:- 
<ul>
    <li>Linux</li>
    <li>Windows</li>
    <li>MacOS</li>
</ul>
Each OS has many versions. Kernel stays the same! but application layer is being developed & improved. <br>
</p>

<p>Operating System for Servers:- <br>
<ul>
    <li>Mostly Linux Based.</li>
    <li>More light-weight & performant.</li>
    <li>No GUI or other user applications.</li>
</ul>
</p>
