Before getting into the need for learning DevOps, one should know what DevOps is.
<p>DevOps is an approach or practice that combines the development team and the IT team to collaborate throughout the entire software development cycle so that all the team will be on the same page. It helps in shortening the SDLC (software development Life cycle) and ensures the delivery of high-quality software.</p>

In simple words, DevOps is just a way of working between Developers & Operations.

Let's understand with previous approach used in SDLC:- <br>

Traditionally, there was a practice of WATERFALL method. <br>

Let's understand it with example:- 
<ul>
<li>Consider a team has to develop FaceBook from scratch, they would first plan everything beforehand about how the app should work, features it should have and make list of features, pages, events, etc.</li>
<li>Then Development Team would take the list of features, events, etc., and documentation how business team envisioned the app. this development team will develop one feature per time, & this will take some months as team will code features, page, etc., and code complete app.</li>
<li>It is then hand-over to Testing Department which would test every feature, app performance, load testing, etc. Testing will done after everything has developed. They might find some bugs or compatibility issues and it will send it back to developer team to fix it, then it will get tested again & this cycle would be done back & forth until everything is ready with no issues. This would take some months.</li>
<li>After developing & testing, it would be passed on to the Operations Team. They will require some preparations as to set the app on server. Then they will resolve dependencies, or some things wouldn't run or breaks, they will again send it to the developers team to fix it, then to testing team to test again & this cycle again would take couple of months. </li>
<li>Maybe after couple of years, the app is ready, deployed and running.</li>
</ul>
This method sounds like TDS long ineffective process. Overtime new requirements may arise, then they need to be resolved. There would be many places of failure & miscommunication. There is no fast feedback.

<p>A very effective method alternative to WATERFALL method was developed called Agile. Agile is very popular among organizations & companies. </p>

Benefits of Agile:- <br>
<ul>
<li>It increases the speed of development, testing and deployment cycles. Instead of waiting for whole application getting developed.</li>
<li>Here each feature gets tested, deployed. There is immediate feedback if there are bugs or deployment doesn't work & so on.</li>
</ul>
An Agile Methology allows to more dynamic, fast, & easily changable development and deployment process.
And Agile is just a methodology or framework that says what are the good practices and efficient ways to do things. It has specific implementations like Scrum & another one Kanban. Depending on company requirements it would use one of them.


The main takeaway is Agile at core is the heart of Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery process which has become so popular that company strives towards in order to make their software development & delivery processes much more efficient.

And the Agile methodology introduction or adoption by companies has supported the need for DevOps taks. Because DevOps is actually implementing the best practices or most of the practices that Agile framework inroduces. 

The main aim of DevOps is CI/CD(Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery) to develop and deploy applications/features as fast as possible and automate tasks.
